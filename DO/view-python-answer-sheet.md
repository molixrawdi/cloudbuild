üêç Python for DevOps ‚Äì Interview Cheat Sheet
1. Log Processing (Large Files)

Read line by line ‚Üí avoid memory issues.

Use regex for IP extraction.

For S3 logs ‚Üí use boto3.get_object() stream.

with open("auth.log") as f:
    for line in f:
        if "Failed password" in line:
            match = re.search(r"\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+", line)

2. SSH Automation (Parallelized)

Use asyncssh with asyncio for hundreds of servers.

Avoid sequential SSH calls.

async def check(host): 
    async with asyncssh.connect(host) as c: 
        return await c.run("echo ok")

3. API Calls with Resilience

Retry with exponential backoff + jitter.

Raise on final failure.

for attempt in range(retries):
    try: requests.get(url).raise_for_status()
    except: time.sleep(delay); delay *= 2

4. Config Management (JSON/YAML)

Parse with yaml.safe_load() or json.load().

Validate with Pydantic.

class Config(BaseModel): app_name: str; replicas: int

5. CI/CD ‚Äì Docker Build & Push

Use docker Python SDK.

Stream build logs for visibility.

client.images.build(path=".", tag="myapp:latest")
client.images.push("myapp:latest")

6. System Monitoring ‚Üí Prometheus

Use psutil to collect CPU/memory.

Expose metrics with prometheus_client.

cpu.set(psutil.cpu_percent())
start_http_server(8000)

‚ö° Key Principles

Efficiency: Always stream logs, don‚Äôt load into memory.

Parallelism: Use asyncio / multiprocessing for scale.

Resilience: Retry with backoff, validate configs, catch failures early.

Integration: Python as glue ‚Üí CI/CD, Docker, Prometheus, APIs.

Maintainability: Modular code, error handling, logging.
